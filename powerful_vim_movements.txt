Powerful Vim Movements:

You can combine the keystrokes in gVim/Vim to get your work done faster. Let's take
a look at a couple of those.

Moving around faster in vim:
Say you have text such as below:

================================================================================
Days
Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday

Numbers
One Two Three Four Five Six Seven Eight Nine Ten Eleven Twelve
================================================================================

Lets say the cursor is currently at the "M" of "Monday" and you want to move over
to the "F" in "Friday". There are many ways to go about this. 
Note - All the movements below are executed in the "Normal" Mode.

1) You keep hitting the "l" key till you reach the "F" of "Friday", not really
efficient. Infact if you were to press and release the L key, it would take 32
strokes to reach the "F".

2) You move Word by Word. Assuming that the cursor is on the "M" of "Monday",hit 
the "w" key. You hit the "w" four times to reach "F" in "Friday".

3) Hit the "f" key and quickly follow it by a capital F, thats shift and "f".
That's it, now your cursor is on the "F" of Friday !!

Now say you want to move to the "W" of Wednesday? Type FW in the normal mode.
the "F" in normal mode will move the cursor backwards, and the "W" tells it to
move it to the "W". so cursor simply jumps back to the W.

The f and F can be used to move anywhere. Try moving to the "a" in all the days.
Assuming that the cursor is on the "S[a]turday" (the [a]is where the cursor is)
type F and then quickly type a. Cursor will then jump back to "Frid[a]y". Hit the
";" key and the cursor will jump to "Thursd[a]y" and so on and so forth.
Typing "fa" will do the opposite.


Lets try the same stuff on the "Numbers" Now.
Find the easiest way to move the cursor from the "T" of "Two" to the "T" of Ten.
You can keep hitting the "W", or try the f movement. However, when you do the fT
movement (In normal mode, type f quickly followed by a capital T), you end up on
Three. Now, hit the ";" key. This key will repeat the last movement. So you are
basically telling the cursor to move to the next "T" by hitting the ";". Try it.

Powerful ways to change/delete/insert text:

Consider the following line:

Here is a line which-has-some-dashes-here. This line needs to be deleted.

Lets say we have to delete the line "This line needs to be deleted." Hitting x key
repeatedly is a big waste of time. Better way to do it is, bring the cursor to the
fullstop between the two sentences, you can do this by doing a "f.", hit d$, 
thats a "d" immediately followed by a "$" and thats it. 

Now lets say you just wanted to delete a word in the line above. Bring the cursor
over to that word and in Normal Mode, type "daw" which stands for Delete Around the
Word. Want to see what more it can do? Just bring the cursor to any word that has
the dashes around it and press "daW" (Thats a d followed by an a and followed by
a capital W).
So here is your line:
Here is a line which-has-some-dashes-here. This line needs to be deleted.

Then lets say you get the cursor to the a of the "-has-" and hit daW, you'll see that
the "which-has-some-dashes-here." part is deleted and we are just left with:

Here is a line This line needs to be deleted.
